Assume that random products are clones of the original products, with modified sale price. Only randomized numerical values in the updated item.

Compile and Run using:

1. `cd project-2/` or navigate to project root directory
2. `javac -d bin src/*.java`
3. `cd bin/`
4. `java main_class`

Our examples of the 6 OO Principles can be found here:
1. Inheritance: See the Music.java file, line 18.
2. Polymorphism: See the Accessories.java file, line 17
3. Abstraction: See the Accessories.java file, line 18
4. Encapsulation: See the Item.java file, line 24
5. Cohesion: See the Person.java file, line 10
6. Identity: See the Store.java file, line 4

Add other assumptions here if necessary.
